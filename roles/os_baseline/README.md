# os_baseline

This role provides a generic OS baseline (packages, time sync, docker, etc.).

This public repo version is being ported and sanitized from a private repo.

## Privacy/safety
- This public repo intentionally ships no real inventory, IPs, hostnames, or provider metadata.
- Any tasks that might embed site-specific values should be parameterized via variables in your private `inventory/`.
