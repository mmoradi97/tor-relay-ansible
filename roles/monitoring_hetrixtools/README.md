# monitoring_hetrixtools

Installs and configures the HetrixTools monitoring agent.

## Privacy/safety
- This public repository does not include any real HetrixTools SIDs.
- Set `hetrixtools_sid` in your private inventory (gitignored) or via runtime vars.

## Notes
The role is designed to be idempotent: it checks for markers/config before running the installer.
