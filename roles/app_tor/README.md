# app_tor (public template)

This role is being ported from the private repo into this public-safe repository.

## What’s included
- The role structure and an empty `files/identity/` directory placeholder.

## What’s intentionally excluded
- Any real Tor identity material, fingerprints, contact info, onion addresses, inventories, or host metadata.

## Status
This role is currently a **stub** to avoid accidental deployment while porting is in progress.

If you want this role to be functional in the public repo, we’ll port the remaining `tasks/`, `defaults/`, `handlers/`, and `templates/` files next (with sanitization).
