# Identity archives

This directory is intentionally kept **empty** in the public repository.

Put any Tor identity archives and other correlating materials in a private location (recommended: outside the git repo entirely, or under `.local/` which is gitignored).

Do not commit:
- Relay fingerprints or family lists
- Operator contact info
- Onion addresses
- Private keys or archives
